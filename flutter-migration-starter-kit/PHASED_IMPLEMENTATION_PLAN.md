    os: "iOS 15"
    region: "MA"
    specs: { ram: "3GB", storage: "64GB" }

network_conditions:
  - name: "2G Nigeria"
    latency: "500ms"
    bandwidth: "0.1 Mbps"
  - name: "3G Kenya"
    latency: "200ms"
    bandwidth: "2 Mbps"

### Phase 5: Data Migration & Deployment (Weeks 9-10)

#### Week 9: Data Migration
**Objectives:**
- Migrate user data without data loss
- Preserve donation history and relationships
- Transfer AI model data and insights

**Migration Pipeline:**
```dart:scripts/migration/
â”œâ”€â”€ user_migration.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ donation_migration.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ ai_data_migration.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ validation_service.dart
â””â”€â”€ rollback_service.dart
```

**Data Validation:**
```dart:migration_validation.dart
class MigrationValidator {
  Future<ValidationResult> validateMigration() async {
    final userCount = await compareUserCounts();
    final donationIntegrity = await validateDonationRelationships();
    final aiDataIntegrity = await validateAIData();

    return ValidationResult(
      isValid: userCount && donationIntegrity && aiDataIntegrity,
      issues: collectIssues(),
      recommendations: generateRecommendations(),
    );
  }
}
```

**Rollback Strategy:**
