**⚠️ IDENTIFIED IMPLEMENTATION GAPS & FIXES:**

#### **Critical Missing Components:**
1. **Battle Pass Redux Slice** - `CoinBattlePassScreen.tsx` imports `fetchBattlePass`, `purchaseBattlePass`, `claimBattlePassReward` from non-existent `battlePassSlice.ts`
   - **Fix:** Create `battlePassSlice.ts` or update imports to use `challengesSlice.ts` functions

#### **Redux State Management Issues:**
