# Build Issues Fixed - Database Schema

## Problem
The build was failing due to missing Prisma models referenced in service files:
- aiRecommendation
- merchant, merchantPaymentRequest, merchantPayment
- corporate, corporateBulkDonation, corporateTeamMember
- socialCircle, socialCircleMember, socialPost

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Prisma Schema (`schema.prisma`)
- Removed duplicate User model definition
- Added missing relations to main User model
- Fixed relation naming conflicts with explicit relation names
- All premium feature models were already defined, just needed proper relations

### 2. Created Migration (`20251016211251_add_premium_features`)
- SQL migration file created with all new tables
- Includes proper indexes for performance
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` for safe re-runs

### 3. Generated Prisma Client
- Successfully generated Prisma Client with all models
- All referenced models now available in codebase

## Tables Added

### AI & Analytics (2 tables)
- AIRecommendation
- AnalyticsEvent

### Merchant System (3 tables)
- Merchant
- MerchantPaymentRequest
- MerchantPayment

### Corporate System (3 tables)
- Corporate
- CorporateBulkDonation
- CorporateTeamMember

### Social Features (6 tables)
- SocialCircle
- SocialCircleMember
- SocialPost
- SocialComment
- SocialLike
- SocialCommentLike

## Next Steps

### 1. Apply Migration to Database
```bash
cd chaingive-backend
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### 2. Remaining TypeScript Errors
The following fields are referenced in code but missing from User model:
- phoneNumber
- isBanned, banReason
- isActive
- tier
- lastLoginAt

Other missing models:
- cycle, kycRecord
- coinSaleToUser, redemption
- transaction (should use $transaction)

### 3. Testing
Once database migration is applied:
- Test AI recommendation endpoints
- Test merchant payment flows
- Test corporate bulk donations
- Test social circle features
- Test analytics event tracking

## Files Modified
- `/chaingive-backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Fixed schema
- `/chaingive-backend/prisma/migrations/20251016211251_add_premium_features/migration.sql` - New migration
- `/chaingive-backend/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Documentation

## Status
✅ Prisma schema fixed
✅ Migration SQL created
✅ Prisma client generated
⏳ Database migration pending (requires DB connection)
⏳ Additional User model fields needed
⏳ Additional models needed (cycle, kycRecord, etc.)
