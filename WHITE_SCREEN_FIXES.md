# White Screen Issues - Fixed

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. Redux Persist Configuration Missing
**Problem**: App was trying to use `persistor` but it wasn't exported from store
**Fix**: Added proper redux-persist configuration to `src/store/store.ts`

### 2. Async i18n Initialization
**Problem**: i18n was initializing asynchronously without proper loading states
**Fix**: Added loading states and proper async handling in `src/App.tsx`

### 3. Missing Error Boundaries
**Problem**: Any JavaScript errors would crash the entire app
**Fix**: Added `ErrorBoundary` component to catch and display errors gracefully

### 4. WebSocket Initialization Crashes
**Problem**: WebSocket service could crash app if connection failed
**Fix**: Made WebSocket initialization non-blocking and added environment checks

### 5. Missing Navigation Container
**Problem**: Navigation wasn't properly wrapped
**Fix**: Added `NavigationContainer` wrapper in App.tsx

## Files Modified

1. **src/store/store.ts** - Added redux-persist configuration
2. **src/App.tsx** - Added error handling, loading states, and proper async initialization
3. **src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx** - New error boundary component
4. **src/components/LoadingScreen.tsx** - New loading screen component
5. **src/services/websocketService.ts** - Made WebSocket initialization more robust
6. **package.json** - Added web and mobile startup scripts
7. **start-web.js** - New web startup script

## How to Run

### Web App
```bash
cd chaingive-mobile
npm run web
# or
npm run start:web
```

### Mobile App
```bash
cd chaingive-mobile
npm run start:android
# or
npm run start:ios
```

### Development Server
```bash
cd chaingive-mobile
npm start
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Graceful Error Handling**: App won't crash on errors, shows user-friendly error screen
2. **Proper Loading States**: Users see loading indicators instead of white screens
3. **Robust Initialization**: App handles failed services gracefully
4. **Redux Persistence**: User data persists between app sessions
5. **Better Development Experience**: Clear startup scripts and error messages

## Testing

1. Start the app with `npm run web` or `npm start`
2. Check that loading screen appears briefly
3. Verify app loads without white screen
4. Test error boundary by triggering an error (if needed)
5. Verify navigation works properly

The white screen issues should now be resolved for both web and mobile platforms.
