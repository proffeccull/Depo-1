## 1. Vision & Mission

### Vision
To build Africa's most trusted peer-to-peer giving platform where generosity flows freely, transparently, and sustainably.

### Mission
Empower communities to break cycles of poverty through structured, accountable, and dignified mutual aid ‚Äî without creating dependency or exploiting vulnerability.

---

## 2. Core Philosophy

### Principles

1. **Pay It Forward, Not Back**
   - When you receive, you give to someone else, not the person who gave to you
   - Breaks the psychological debt of reciprocity

2. **Dignity First**
   - No begging, no sob stories required
   - Everyone is both giver and receiver
   - Trauma-aware design language

3. **Radical Transparency**
   - All flows visible on blockchain
   - Public impact dashboard
   - Community-led moderation

4. **Anti-Exploitation**
   - No interest, no debt
   - Caps on donation amounts
   - Time-based cooldowns to prevent abuse

5. **Community Sovereignty**
   - Users govern themselves through CSC Council
   - Local agents validate trust
   - Platform serves, doesn't control

---

## 3. Product Overview

**ChainGive** is a mobile-first platform that enables:
- Peer-to-peer donations in structured cycles
- Transparent tracking via blockchain
- Charity Coin rewards that convert to real-world value
- Agent-assisted onboarding for digital literacy gaps
- Marketplace for social impact purchases

**What Makes Us Different:**
- Not a loan platform (no repayment required)
- Not a giveaway scheme (you give back to the community)
- Not charity (you participate actively, not passively)
- Not a Ponzi (no returns promised, no recruitment incentives)

---

## 4. How It Works

### The 30-Second Explanation

1. **You receive** a donation from someone in the network
2. **When able**, you donate the same amount to someone else
3. **You earn** Charity Coins for completing cycles
4. **You spend** Charity Coins in the marketplace for services/goods

### The 5-Minute Deep Dive

**Step 1: Onboarding**
- Download app or visit web portal
- Verify identity (BVN or NIN for Nigerians, Agent verification for others)
- Set giving capacity (‚Ç¶500 ‚Äì ‚Ç¶50,000)

**Step 2: Matching**
- Algorithm pairs you with a donor based on:
  - Geographic proximity
  - Trust score
  - Donation amount compatibility

**Step 3: Receiving**
- Donor sends funds via bank transfer, Opay, Palmpay, etc.
- You confirm receipt in-app
- Escrow releases to your wallet

**Step 4: Giving**
- When ready (7-90 days), you donate same amount forward
- Choose recipient or let algorithm match
- Confirm donation in-app

**Step 5: Rewards**
- Earn Charity Coins based on:
  - Speed of payment
  - Consistency of cycles
  - Community endorsements

**Step 6: Marketplace**
- Redeem Charity Coins for:
  - Airtime
  - Data bundles
  - School fees support
  - Health vouchers
  - Agent services

## 5. User Roles *(Clarified Access)*

| Role | Device Requirement | How They Join | Responsibilities |
|------|--------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Beginner** | Smartphone or shared device | Download app or visit web portal | Complete first 3 donation cycles |
| **Agent** | Smartphone (recommended) | Must verify identity via camera upload | Verify users, facilitate cash transactions, educate community |
| **Power Partner** | Smartphone | Uses full feature set including referrals, impact tracking | 10+ completed cycles, mentor others, earn bonus Charity Coins |
| **CSC Council Member** | Smartphone | Elected by community quarterly | Mediate disputes, review fraud cases, vote on policy changes |

> üí° **Note**: Users without smartphones can still participate *through trusted agents* (e.g., POS vendors helping them transact), but **self-service requires app access**.

---

## 6. Donation Cycle Mechanics *(Simplified Flow)*

### Cycle States

1. **Pending**: Matched with donor, awaiting transfer
2. **In Transit**: Donor confirmed send, awaiting your confirmation
3. **Received**: You confirmed, funds in escrow (48hr hold)
4. **Released**: Funds available in your wallet
5. **Obligated**: You now owe forward donation
6. **Fulfilled**: You donated forward, cycle complete

### Timeframes

- **Receive ‚Üí Give**: 7-90 days (recommended 30)
- **Escrow Hold**: 48 hours after confirmation
- **Dispute Window**: 14 days after cycle completion

### Confirmation Process

With no USSD fallback:
- All donation confirmations happen **in-app**
- Escrow release requires **manual confirmation inside the app**
- Push notifications replace SMS alerts (opt-in)

> üîî **Example Notification**:  
> "Emeka has donated to you! Confirm receipt in the ChainGive app."

**If user is inactive for 7 days:**
- Gentle email/SMS reminder: "Open the app to complete your cycle"
- No automatic actions via USSD

### Default Handling

If you don't donate forward within 90 days:
- **Soft Reminder**: Notification + email
- **Trust Score Hit**: -10 points (recoverable)
- **Temporary Pause**: Can't receive new donations until fulfilled
- **No Penalty Fees**: We don't punish poverty

---

## 7. Wallet & Financial Architecture

### Wallet Type: Custodial
- Platform manages private keys
- Simplified UX for non-crypto users
- Regulatory compliance easier

### Structure

```
User Account
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Fiat Wallet (‚Ç¶ NGN)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Receivable Balance (locked until escrow clears)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Available Balance (withdrawable)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Pending Obligations (amount you owe forward)
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Charity Coin Wallet
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Earned Coins (non-transferable, marketplace only)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Bonus Coins (from referrals, special campaigns)
```

### Transaction Flows

---

## 9. Matching Algorithm

### Inputs

1. **User Preferences**
   - Donation amount
   - Geographic preference (same city?)
   - Faith alignment (optional)

2. **Trust Scores**
   - Completion rate
   - Speed of fulfillment
   - Community endorsements
   - Agent verification status

3. **System Health**
   - Balance givers vs receivers in region
   - Prevent cliques (same people always matching)
   - Prioritize first-time receivers

### Matching Logic

```
Priority Score = 
  (Trust Score √ó 0.4) + 
  (Geographic Proximity √ó 0.2) + 
  (Amount Match √ó 0.2) + 
  (Wait Time √ó 0.2)
```

### Anti-Gaming Measures

- Can't match with same person twice in 6 months
- New users matched with high-trust givers first
- Randomization factor prevents predictability

---

## 20. Ethical Guardrails

### Red Lines (We Will Never...)

1. **Charge interest** on any transaction
2. **Sell user data** to third parties
3. **Gamify poverty** (no "saddest story wins" contests)
4. **Allow unlimited donations** (prevents desperation spirals)
5. **Hide fees** (all costs disclosed upfront)
6. **Pressure users** to give before they're ready
7. **Allow anonymous donations** (reduces fraud, increases accountability)

### Design Principles

**Trauma-Aware UX:**
- No red/aggressive colors in debt reminders
- Language audit by psychologists
- Opt-out options for triggering content

**Dignity-Centered Copywriting:**
- ‚úÖ "When you're ready to give forward..."
- ‚ùå "You owe ‚Ç¶5,000. Pay now!"

**Accessibility:**
- Screen reader support
- Low-bandwidth mode (<50KB data per session)
- Pidgin English option
- Audio guides for low-literacy users

---

## 21. Roadmap (Next 12 Months) ‚Äì Updated

| Quarter | Goals | Key Features |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| **Q1 2025** | MVP launch: Lagos pilot, 50 Agents, 2K users *(app-only)* | Basic donation cycles, Bank transfer integration, Agent onboarding |
| **Q2 2025** | Roll out Charity Coin Marketplace, crypto deposit rail | Marketplace v1 (airtime, data), Opay/Palmpay integration, Trust score v2 |
| **Q3 2025** | Expand to Abuja, PH, Ibadan; optimize for low-bandwidth networks | Offline mode, PWA support, Agent sub-networks |

> üì± **Focus**: Lightweight app (<15MB), offline mode for slow areas, PWA support for non-installed access

---

## 22. Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

| Platform | Model | Weakness |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Zelle (US)** | P2P payments | No giving structure, US-only |
| **M-Changa (Kenya)** | Crowdfunding | One-directional, no forward obligation |
| **esusu.ng** | Savings groups | Requires upfront contributions, limited to groups |

### Indirect Competitors

| Category | Example | Why We're Different |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| **Microfinance** | Kuda, FairMoney | We don't charge interest or require repayment |
| **Charity Platforms** | GoFundMe, JustGiving | We create mutual obligation, not one-way giving |
| **Buy Now Pay Later** | Carbon, Branch | We're not credit, no debt traps |
| **Crypto Lending** | Aave, Compound | No collateral required, fiat-first |

### Our Moat

1. **Network Effects:** More users = better matches = faster cycles
2. **Trust Infrastructure:** Agents + CSC + blockchain = unmatched transparency
3. **Cultural Fit:** Built for African collectivist values, not Western individualism
4. **Regulatory Compliance:** PSP license = legitimacy competitors lack

---

## 23. Missing Features (Future Backlog) ‚Äì Updated

| **Group Challenges** | Low | "This church completes 100 cycles this month" | Q4 2026 |
| **Green Hosting Initiative** | Low | Carbon-neutral servers | Q2 2027 |
| **Offline-First Architecture** | Medium | Full functionality without internet (sync when online) | Q4 2025 |

> ‚ùå **USSD Onboarding / Payments**: Not planned in v1‚Äìv2

And now ‚Äî **simple, safe, and focused**.

No distractions.  
No technical debt.  
Just kindness, moving forward.
