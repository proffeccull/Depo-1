# üìù ChainGive Comprehensive TODO (v5)

_Last updated: 2025-10-12_

This document synthesizes all implementation, feature, bug, and optimization requirements from V1 to the latest round of gap analysis, including mobile, backend, gamification, and cross-cutting concerns.

## üö® CRITICAL GAPS AND MUST-FIXES

### Backend

- [ ] **Validation Schemas**: Create missing validation schema files for all entities, especially:
  - `coinPurchase.validation.ts`
  - `referral.validation.ts`
  - `dispute.validation.ts`
  - `adminAdvanced.validation.ts`
  - `cycle.validation.ts`
  - `match.validation.ts`
  - `notification.validation.ts`
  - `upload.validation.ts`
- [ ] **Referral System Integration**: Ensure referral bonus functions are called at:
  - Registration (referral code)
  - 1st and 3rd cycle completions
  - Leaderboard updates (referral triggers)
  - Update in `auth.controller.ts` & `escrow-release.job.ts`
- [ ] **Withdrawal Rate Limiter**: Wire up advanced rate limiting middleware to withdrawal endpoints.
- [ ] **Feature Flags**: Apply feature flag middleware (`requireFeature`) to all routes for modular feature rollout and toggling.

### Mobile

- [ ] **Navigation Gaps**: Integrate all orphaned screens into navigation:
  - Admin: UserManagementScreen, TransactionMonitoringScreen, DisputeManagementScreen, CryptoPaymentSettingsScreen, CryptoPaymentConfirmationScreen
  - Agent: BuyCoinsWithCryptoScreen
- [ ] **API Endpoints**: Implement all missing backend endpoints for Crypto Payment, Admin Management, and Agent flows (see MISSING-IMPLEMENTATION-GAPS.md).
- [ ] **Database**: Add missing tables for crypto_payment_configs, crypto_coins, crypto_payments, crypto_payment_logs.

## üèóÔ∏è PHASED ENHANCEMENTS (ALL SYSTEMS)

### Backend

- [ ] **Agent Coin System**: Ensure all endpoints and coin inventory management are robust and tested.
- [ ] **Leaderboard & Gamification**:
  - Finish Prisma schema fixes.
  - Complete admin config models and endpoints.
  - Ensure backend triggers missions/achievements on all appropriate user actions.
  - Add missing gamification notification triggers (push, email, FCM).
- [ ] **Background Jobs**: Audit and extend jobs for:
  - Escrow auto-release
  - Match expiration
  - Cycle reminders
  - Leaderboard recalculation
  - Trust score penalties
  - Boost expiration
- [ ] **Push & SMS Notifications**: Extend templates, triggers, and device/token management.
- [ ] **File/Upload Handling**: Validate file types/sizes, serve static files securely, and enforce limits for all upload categories.
- [ ] **Security**: Add/review rate-limiting, JWT, input validation, and feature flag coverage.

### Mobile

- [ ] **Screen Completion**: Implement and connect all remaining screens (see IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md). Prioritize:
  - SignUpScreen, ForgotPasswordScreen
  - TransactionHistoryScreen, TransactionDetailScreen
  - CycleDetailScreen, CycleHistoryScreen, ConfirmReceiptScreen
  - ItemDetailScreen, RedemptionHistoryScreen
  - VerifyUserScreen, AgentStatsScreen
  - NotificationsScreen, ProfileScreen, SettingsScreen, HelpScreen
- [ ] **Redux/State**: Ensure all screens use Redux slices with correct backend integration.
- [ ] **Haptic & Animation Polish**: Expand haptic feedback, skeleton loaders, animated numbers, modals, and error/empty states as per latest gamification UX docs.
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Increase from 0% to at least 60% for critical flows.

### Gamification

- [ ] **Admin Dashboard**: Finalize and test all CRUD for missions, challenges, achievements, streaks, and feature toggles.
- [ ] **Mobile Gamification**: Complete all UI for Missions, Streaks, Progress Rings, Challenges, Achievements, Rewards.
- [ ] **Confetti/Unlock Animations**: Polish for milestone events.
- [ ] **Push/Email Integration**: Tie achievement/milestone events to notifications.

## üìù GENERAL ENHANCEMENTS & OPTIMIZATIONS

- [ ] **Documentation**: Update main README, specs, and in-code comments to reflect all new features, routes, and models.
- [ ] **Code Quality**: Refactor controllers/routes to use extracted validation and feature flag middleware.
- [ ] **Performance**: Index all new tables; audit API endpoints for N+1 queries and optimize.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Implement centralized error reporting/logging (e.g., Sentry everywhere).
- [ ] **Security**: Review for missing auth, input validation, and rate limiting.
- [ ] **CI/CD**: Ensure all new scripts, migrations, and validations run in CI/CD pipelines.
- [ ] **Changelog**: Maintain a detailed CHANGELOG.md for all major changes.
- [ ] **Feature Flags**: Build UI for toggling in admin dashboard.

## üî• FEATURES/FUTURE (NICE-TO-HAVE)

- [ ] **WebSockets/Realtime**: Upgrade polling for chat, notifications, and critical updates.
- [ ] **AI-Assisted Mediation**: Auto-classify disputes, suggest resolutions, flag fraud patterns.
- [ ] **Mobile Offline Mode**: Queue actions and sync when reconnected.
- [ ] **Advanced Analytics**: Mediation, agent, and user leaderboards; fraud/abuse dashboards.
- [ ] **Video Evidence**: Backend and UI support for <5MB, 30s video uploads.
- [ ] **Localization**: Multi-language support for system messages, chat, and templates.

## üèÅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- [ ] All validation, security, and feature flag gaps closed.
- [ ] 100% of navigation and endpoint gaps resolved.
- [ ] Admin dashboard and gamification fully configurable and testable.
- [ ] >90% of transactions handled by automated flows; <5% require manual/admin intervention.
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage on backend validation, major flows, and critical error cases.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PROCESS RULE

- **Before creating replica files or duplicating features, always check for availability or existing implementation.**  
  - Search for existing code, feature flags, or documentation.
  - Only proceed if the feature/file/module does not already exist or is not implemented.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTES

- Only the most recent 10 .md files per search were analyzed‚Äî[view all docs here](https://github.com/proffeccull/Depo-1/search?q=extension%3Amd).
- For absolute completeness, run a local grep or provide all .md files.
