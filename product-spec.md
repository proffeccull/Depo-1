## 1. Executive Summary

ChainGive is a mobile-first, peer-to-peer giving platform designed to foster sustainable community support networks in Nigeria. It leverages the "pay it forward" model, allowing users to receive financial help in times of need and contribute back to the community when they are able. The platform is built on the principles of dignity and transparency, creating a system of ethical altruism without incurring debt.

This document outlines the complete specification for ChainGive v2.2, detailing a product that is secure, scalable, and intuitive. It introduces a modern, dark-themed user interface focused on clarity and data visualization to build user trust and engagement. The primary goal is to launch a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in Lagos by Q2 2026, contingent on regulatory approval, with a five-year vision of empowering 500,000 active users and generating sustainable revenue through transaction fees and a value-added marketplace. Enhancements in v2.2 include improved AI matching algorithms, expanded marketplace offerings, and advanced fraud detection to support broader adoption and ecosystem stability.

## 3. User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) Design

The design of ChainGive is engineered to inspire trust, promote clarity, and make financial data feel empowering. The aesthetic is modern, clean, and data-rich, drawing inspiration from leading neobank and fintech applications.

### 3.1 Design Philosophy
*   **Theme:** A **dark theme** will be used as the primary interface. This creates a premium, secure feel, reduces eye strain in low-light conditions, and allows vibrant accent colors and data visualizations to stand out.
*   **Clarity & Focus:** The layout will prioritize a clear visual hierarchy. Key information, such as balances and calls-to-action, will be prominent. Ample whitespace and a card-based structure will be used to organize information cleanly.
*   **Data as Empowerment:** Complex data will be presented through simple, elegant charts and graphs, enabling users to understand their impact and financial activity at a glance.

### 3.2 Design System

---

## 10. Compliance Framework

The ChainGive platform will operate in full compliance with all relevant Nigerian regulations.

*   **Money Transfer License:** This is the most critical regulatory requirement. The application process will be initiated in Month 1 of the development roadmap and is a mandatory prerequisite for public launch.
*   **NDPR:** A Data Protection Officer will be appointed. The platform will undergo an annual audit to ensure compliance with data protection laws.
*   **AML/CFT:** The platform will implement KYC procedures (via agents) and continuous transaction monitoring to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.
*   **PCI DSS:** While we will use compliant payment processors like Flutterwave and will not store card details directly, we will adhere to best practices to ensure the security of the payment ecosystem.

CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  phone_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  city VARCHAR(100),

  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

### Appendix C: AI Matching Algorithm Overview (New in v2.2)

The AI matching system uses a weighted scoring model to pair donors with recipients:
- **Location Proximity:** 30% weight â€“ Prioritizes local matches to build community ties.
- **Trust Score:** 25% weight â€“ Higher trust scores for both parties increase match likelihood.
- **Need Urgency:** 20% weight â€“ Based on category (e.g., emergency > education).
- **Donor Preferences:** 15% weight â€“ Allows donors to filter by category or amount range.
- **Randomization:** 10% weight â€“ Ensures fairness and prevents bias.

The algorithm is implemented using Python with scikit-learn for initial models, transitioning to TensorFlow for advanced ML as user data grows.
