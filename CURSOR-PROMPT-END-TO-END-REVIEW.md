## üìã PROMPT FOR CURSOR AI

```
You are an expert React Native developer and UX designer reviewing the ChainGive mobile application. 

Perform a comprehensive end-to-end analysis and enhancement focusing on:

1. IMPLEMENTATION GAPS
   - Check all screens for missing API integrations
   - Verify all Redux slices are connected to real APIs (not mock data)
   - Check for missing error states and loading states
   - Identify any broken navigation flows
   - Find any TODO comments or incomplete implementations
   - Check for missing form validations
   - Verify all user journeys are complete (no dead ends)

2. UI/UX ENHANCEMENTS
   - Review all screens for consistency with ChainGive brand colors
   - Check typography consistency across screens
   - Identify missing animations and transitions
   - Look for poor spacing or alignment issues
   - Check touch target sizes (minimum 44x44)
   - Review empty states - ensure all have helpful messages and CTAs
   - Check loading states - ensure skeleton screens or spinners
   - Review error states - ensure user-friendly messages
   - Identify missing feedback (haptics, toasts, confirmations)
   - Check for accessibility issues (screen reader labels, contrast)

3. CODE QUALITY
   - Check for duplicate code that should be extracted to components
   - Look for hard-coded values that should be in theme
   - Verify TypeScript types are complete (no 'any' types)
   - Check for proper error boundaries
   - Review performance issues (unnecessary re-renders, large lists without virtualization)
   - Check for memory leaks (listeners, timers not cleaned up)

4. NAVIGATION & DEEP LINKING
   - Verify all screens are added to navigators
   - Check for proper screen options (headers, titles)
   - Ensure back button behavior is correct
   - Check for missing deep link configurations
   - Verify navigation params are typed

5. AGENT-BASED P2P SYSTEM SPECIFIC
   - Verify escrow flow is clearly explained to users
   - Check agent selection UI is intuitive
   - Ensure pending requests show clear status
   - Verify contact agent functionality works
   - Check commission display for agents

6. POLISH & REFINEMENTS
   - Add micro-interactions (button press feedback, swipe gestures)
   - Improve empty states with illustrations or icons
   - Add success celebrations (confetti on cycle completion)
   - Improve form UX (auto-focus next field, smart defaults)
   - Add helpful tooltips on first use
   - Improve pull-to-refresh experience
   - Add skeleton screens for better perceived performance

7. SECURITY & VALIDATION
   - Check all inputs have proper validation
   - Verify sensitive data is not logged
   - Check for proper token storage
   - Verify API calls use HTTPS in production
   - Check for SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
   - Verify proper error handling doesn't expose internals

8. MOBILE-SPECIFIC
   - Check keyboard handling (dismiss on scroll, proper return key)
   - Verify SafeAreaView on all screens
   - Check both iOS and Android edge cases
   - Review gesture conflicts
   - Check offline behavior
   - Verify proper permissions (camera, location if needed)

For each issue found:
- Categorize severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Provide specific file and line number
- Suggest concrete fix with code example
- Explain the UX impact

Start with the most critical issues first and provide actionable recommendations.

Analyze these directories:
- /workspace/chaingive-mobile/src/screens/
- /workspace/chaingive-mobile/src/components/
- /workspace/chaingive-mobile/src/services/
- /workspace/chaingive-mobile/src/store/
- /workspace/chaingive-mobile/src/navigation/

Generate a comprehensive report with:
1. Critical Issues (fix immediately)
2. High Priority Issues (fix before launch)
3. Medium Priority Issues (fix in next sprint)
4. Low Priority Issues (nice to have)
5. UI/UX Enhancement Suggestions
6. Code Quality Improvements
```

## üéØ Expected Output

The AI will provide a detailed report like:

```
üîç CHAINGIVE END-TO-END REVIEW REPORT
=====================================

üìä SUMMARY
- Critical Issues: 3
- High Priority: 8
- Medium Priority: 12
- Low Priority: 15
- Total Issues: 38

üö® CRITICAL ISSUES
=================

1. [CRITICAL] Missing Error Boundary in App.tsx
   File: src/App.tsx
   Issue: No global error boundary to catch crashes
   Impact: App crashes show white screen to users
   
   Fix:
   ```tsx
   import ErrorBoundary from './components/common/ErrorBoundary';
   
   function App() {
     return (
       <ErrorBoundary>
         <NavigationContainer>
           ...
         </NavigationContainer>
       </ErrorBoundary>
     );
   }
   ```

2. [CRITICAL] Navigation types missing
   File: src/navigation/types.ts
   Issue: Navigation params not typed, causing runtime errors
   Impact: Type safety broken, prone to crashes
   
   Fix: Create src/navigation/types.ts with:
   ```tsx
   export type RootStackParamList = {
     Home: undefined;
     GiveScreen: undefined;
     BuyCoinsScreen: undefined;
     CycleDetail: { cycleId: string };
     // ... etc
   };
   ```

... (continues with all issues)

üé® UI/UX ENHANCEMENTS
====================

1. [HIGH] Add Skeleton Screens
   Current: Blank screen while loading
   Suggestion: Add skeleton placeholders
   Impact: Better perceived performance
   
   Example for TransactionHistoryScreen:
   ```tsx
   {loading ? (
     <SkeletonPlaceholder>
       <TransactionCardSkeleton />
       <TransactionCardSkeleton />
     </SkeletonPlaceholder>
   ) : (
     <FlatList data={transactions} ... />
   )}
   ```

... (continues with all suggestions)
```
