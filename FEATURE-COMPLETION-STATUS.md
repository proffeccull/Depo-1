## 💡 **Bottom Line**

### **Current State**

- 🟡 **Partial Features:** Core screens exist but incomplete
- 🔴 **Missing Flows:** Can't complete donation cycle end-to-end

### **Gaps**
- **Critical:** 5 features (OTP, Give, Deposit, Withdraw, KYC)
- **High:** 6 features (Agent, Checkout, Cycles, etc.)
- **Medium:** 8 features (Notifications, Onboarding, etc.)
- **Low:** 3 features (Animations, Localization, etc.)

### **Recommendation**
Focus on **completing 1-2 critical features per week** for the next 6 weeks to reach MVP status.

**Priority Order:**
1. OTP Verification (Week 1)
2. Give/Donate Screen (Week 2)
3. Deposit Screen (Week 3)
4. Withdraw Screen (Week 4)
5. KYC Verification (Week 5)
6. Cycle Management (Week 6)

After 6 weeks → **Testable MVP** ✅
