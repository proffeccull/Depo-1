## üìù Notes

**Important Reminders:**

1. Test escrow logic thoroughly - prevents fraud
2. Agent ratings are critical - affects trust
3. Notification system is key - keeps users engaged
4. Monitor dispute resolution - impacts reputation
5. Performance matters - users won't wait

**Known Risks:**

1. Agent liquidity - What if no agents have coins?
2. Dispute resolution - Need clear SLA
3. Agent fraud - Need vetting process
4. User education - Need onboarding flow
5. Network issues - Need offline handling
