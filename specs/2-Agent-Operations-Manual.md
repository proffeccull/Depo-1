| **Multiple Accounts** | Same person creating accounts under different names | Reject new accounts, report pattern |

### ‚úÖ Verification Steps for Suspicious Users

**If Something Feels Off:**

1. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**
   - "What's your date of birth?" (check against ID)
   - "What's your home address?" (check against utility bill)
   - "Why are you joining ChainGive?" (listen for inconsistencies)

2. **Check Transaction History**
   - New account (<7 days)? Extra caution.
   - Previous disputes? Review details.

3. **Call HQ Hotline**
   - WhatsApp: +234-XXX-XXXX
   - Email: agents@chaingive.ng
   - Get approval before proceeding

**Remember:** Better to delay verification than enable fraud.
