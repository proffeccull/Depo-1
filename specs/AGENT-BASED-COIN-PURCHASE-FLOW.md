**Last Updated:** October 6, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **Fully Implemented**  
**Type:** P2P Cash-to-Coins Exchange with Escrow

## 📋 Overview

ChainGive uses a **P2P agent-based system** for users to buy coins. There are **NO online payment gateways** (Flutterwave, Paystack, etc.). Users buy coins directly from agents using cash or bank transfers, with an escrow system to ensure security.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### **Database Flow**

```sql
-- 1. User creates purchase request
INSERT INTO agent_coin_purchases (
  userId,
  agentId,
  amount,
  status = 'PENDING',
  paymentMethod
);

-- 2. Escrow locks agent's coins
UPDATE agents 
SET availableCoins = availableCoins - amount,
    escrowedCoins = escrowedCoins + amount
WHERE id = agentId;

-- Update purchase status
UPDATE agent_coin_purchases 
SET status = 'ESCROW_LOCKED';

-- 3. Agent confirms payment
UPDATE agent_coin_purchases 
SET status = 'COMPLETED',
    agentConfirmedAt = NOW();

-- 4. Release coins to user
UPDATE users 
SET balance = balance + amount
WHERE id = userId;

-- 5. Release escrow and add commission
UPDATE agents 
SET escrowedCoins = escrowedCoins - amount,
    commissionEarned = commissionEarned + (amount * 0.02);
```

## 💰 Commission Structure

| Transaction Amount | Agent Commission | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|---------|
| ₦1,000 | 2% = ₦20 | User pays ₦1,000, Agent keeps ₦20 |
| ₦5,000 | 2% = ₦100 | User pays ₦5,000, Agent keeps ₦100 |
| ₦10,000 | 2% = ₦200 | User pays ₦10,000, Agent keeps ₦200 |

**Note:** Commission is earned ONLY when agent confirms payment.

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Handling

### **1. User Doesn't Send Payment**

**Scenario:** User requests coins but never sends money to agent  
**Solution:**
- Agent can reject after waiting period (e.g., 30 mins)
- Agent's coins are unlocked
- User cannot reuse the request

### **2. Agent Doesn't Confirm Payment**

**Scenario:** User sends money but agent doesn't confirm  
**Solution:**
- User can file dispute
- Support team reviews
- User provides proof of payment
- Support manually releases coins or refunds

### **3. User Cancels After Sending Payment**

**Scenario:** User sends money then clicks cancel  
**Solution:**
- System warns: "Have you sent payment? This will cancel your request"
- If user confirms, agent is notified
- Agent can still confirm (escrow remains until timeout)
- Prevents accidental cancellations

### **4. Network Failure During Confirmation**

**Scenario:** Agent confirms but network fails  
**Solution:**
- Transaction is idempotent (can retry)
- Agent sees "Confirming..." state
- On network restore, auto-retries
- If fails, transaction stays in pending
