# 🚂 **RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT - COMPLETE FIX**

**The "start.sh not found" error is now FIXED!**

---

## ✅ **WHAT WAS FIXED**

### **Problem:**
```
❌ Script start.sh not found
❌ Railpack could not determine how to build the app
```

### **Solution:**
```
✅ Added railway.json to REPOSITORY ROOT
✅ Added nixpacks.toml to REPOSITORY ROOT  
✅ Added Procfile to backend
✅ Updated package.json scripts
✅ Configured paths for monorepo structure
```

---

## 📁 **NEW FILE STRUCTURE**

### **Repository Root:**
```
/
├── railway.json          ✅ NEW - Railway configuration
├── nixpacks.toml         ✅ NEW - Build configuration
├── chaingive-backend/
│   ├── Procfile          ✅ NEW - Process configuration
│   ├── start.sh          ✅ EXISTS
│   ├── package.json      ✅ UPDATED with postinstall
│   └── ... (source code)
├── chaingive-mobile/
├── specs/
└── README.md
```

**Key Point:** Railway needs `railway.json` and `nixpacks.toml` in the **repository root**, not in the backend subdirectory!

---

## 🚀 **DEPLOY TO RAILWAY NOW**

### **Step 1: Go to Railway**
👉 https://railway.app/

### **Step 2: Create New Project**
1. Click **"New Project"**
2. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Choose repository: **`Depo`**
4. Railway will detect the configuration automatically!

### **Step 3: Railway Auto-Detects**
Railway will now see:
- ✅ `nixpacks.toml` in root → Knows it's a Node.js project
- ✅ Configuration specifies `chaingive-backend` directory
- ✅ Build commands configured
- ✅ Start command configured

**NO manual configuration needed!**

### **Step 4: Add Environment Variables**

Click your service → **"Variables"** tab:

```bash
DATABASE_URL
postgresql://postgres.mmxzndkglilnxwukpptt:deoi_101dxx90*@aws-1-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres

JWT_SECRET
chaingive-jwt-secret-change-in-production-please

JWT_REFRESH_SECRET
chaingive-refresh-secret-change-in-production-please

NODE_ENV
production

PORT
${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_PORT}}
```

**Note:** Railway automatically provides `PORT` variable, use `${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_PORT}}`

### **Step 5: Generate Domain**
1. Go to **"Settings"** tab
2. Scroll to **"Networking"**
3. Click **"Generate Domain"**
4. Copy your URL: `https://your-app.up.railway.app`

### **Step 6: Deploy!**
Railway deploys automatically after you add environment variables!

Watch the build logs in real-time.

## 📊 **BUILD PROCESS**

### **What Railway Does:**

```
1. Detects nixpacks.toml in root ✅
2. Changes to chaingive-backend directory
3. Runs: npm ci
4. Runs: npx prisma generate
5. Runs: npm run build (TypeScript compilation)
6. Starts: node dist/server.js
```

### **Expected Timeline:**
```
00:00 - Build starts
00:01 - Installing dependencies (npm ci)
00:03 - Generating Prisma Client
00:05 - Building TypeScript
00:08 - Build complete ✅
00:09 - Starting container
00:10 - Health check passed ✅
00:11 - LIVE! 🎉
```

**Total: 10-12 minutes**

---

## ✅ **VERIFICATION**

### **Check Build Logs:**
Look for these success messages:
```
✅ npm ci completed
✅ Prisma Client generated
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Build completed
✅ Starting server
✅ Health check passed
```

### **Test Your API:**
```bash
# Replace with your Railway URL
RAILWAY_URL="https://your-app.up.railway.app"

# Health check
curl $RAILWAY_URL/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-07T..."
}

# API test
curl $RAILWAY_URL/api/v1/leaderboard/global
```

## 🔧 **CONFIGURATION FILES EXPLAINED**

### **1. railway.json (Repository Root)**
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "cd chaingive-backend && node dist/server.js",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health"
  }
}
```
**Purpose:** Tells Railway to use Nixpacks and where to start the app.

### **2. nixpacks.toml (Repository Root)**
```toml
[variables]
NIXPACKS_PATH = "chaingive-backend"

[phases.install]
cmds = ["cd chaingive-backend", "npm ci"]

[phases.build]
cmds = [
  "cd chaingive-backend",
  "npx prisma generate",
  "npm run build"
]

[start]
cmd = "cd chaingive-backend && node dist/server.js"
```
**Purpose:** Configures the build process for monorepo structure.

### **3. Procfile (Backend Directory)**
```
web: node dist/server.js
```
**Purpose:** Tells Railway what command runs the web server.

### **4. package.json (Updated Scripts)**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npm run prisma:generate && tsc",
    "postinstall": "prisma generate"
  }
}
```
**Purpose:** Ensures Prisma Client is generated during install and build.

---

## 🆘 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Error: "Could not determine how to build"**

**Fix:** Make sure `railway.json` and `nixpacks.toml` are in **repository root**, not in `chaingive-backend/`

**Verify:**
```bash
ls /workspace/ | grep -E "railway|nixpacks"
# Should show:
# nixpacks.toml
# railway.json
```

### **Error: "Prisma Client not generated"**

**Fix:** This is now handled by `postinstall` script in package.json

**Verify:**
```json
"postinstall": "prisma generate"
```

### **Error: "Cannot find module './dist/server.js'"**

**Fix:** Check build logs - TypeScript compilation may have failed

**Common causes:**
- Missing dependencies
- TypeScript errors
- Wrong working directory

### **Error: "Database connection failed"**

**Fix:** Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable:
- Use Supabase **connection pooler** URL
- Format: `postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/database`
- Check Supabase allows connections from Railway IP

## 💡 **PRO TIPS**

### **1. View Logs:**
Railway Dashboard → Your Service → **"Deployments"** → Click latest → View logs

### **2. Redeploy:**
If you make changes:
- Push to GitHub → Railway auto-redeploys
- Or click **"Redeploy"** button in Railway

### **3. Custom Domain:**
Settings → Networking → Add custom domain → Update DNS

### **4. Scale Up:**
Settings → Resources → Increase RAM/CPU as needed

### **5. Environment Variables:**
Use Railway's built-in secrets:
```
${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_PORT}}  - Automatically set
${{DATABASE_URL}}         - Your database
```

---

## 🎯 **ALTERNATIVE: DEPLOY WITHOUT SUBDIRECTORY**

If Railway still has issues with monorepo, you can:

### **Option A: Deploy Backend Only**
1. Create new repo: `chaingive-backend-deploy`
2. Copy only `chaingive-backend/` contents
3. Deploy from that repo

### **Option B: Use Railway CLI**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link project
railway link

# Deploy
railway up
```
