Subject: Re: "Is ChainGive a Ponzi Scheme?" ‚Äì Request for Correction

Dear [Editor Name],

We appreciate TechCabal's coverage, but we'd like to clarify some inaccuracies in today's article.

Corrections Requested:

1. "ChainGive promises returns" ‚Üí FALSE

2. "Users can't withdraw" ‚Üí MISLEADING
   We processed 10,000 withdrawals last month (avg time: 4 hours).
   The 3 cases in your article involved KYC verification delays, not withdrawal blocks.

Supporting Evidence:
- CBN PSP License: [Attachment]
- Bank statements: [Link]
- User testimonials: [Link]

We'd welcome the chance to discuss this in detail. Can we schedule a call?

Best,
[CMO Name]
Head of Communications, ChainGive
