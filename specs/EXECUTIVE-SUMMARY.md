# 🎯 ChainGive Backend - Executive Summary

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Status:** 70% Complete, Ready for Final Push

---

## 📚 **What ChainGive Is**

A **gamified peer-to-peer donation platform** where:

1. **Users donate to each other in cycles**
   - Receive ₦5,000 from User A
   - Pay forward ₦5,000 to User B
   - Earn Charity Coins for completing quickly
   - Build trust score

2. **Charity Coins are the reward currency**
   - Earned by completing cycles
   - Purchased from Agents (not payment gateways!)
   - Spent on:
     - Marketplace items (airtime, data, vouchers)
     - Leaderboard boosts (visibility, multipliers, position jumps)

3. **Agents are the distribution network**
   - Buy coins in bulk from Admin (via crypto: BTC, USDT)
   - Sell coins to users (cash/bank transfer)
   - Verify user identities (KYC)
   - Earn commissions

4. **Leaderboard drives competition**
   - Users ranked by donations, cycles, speed
   - Spend coins to boost ranking
   - Gamification increases engagement

## 💡 **Key Insight**

**No payment gateways needed!** 

- Users DON'T buy coins directly via Flutterwave/Paystack
- Agents buy coins from Admin (crypto)
- Users buy coins from Agents (cash/transfer)
- This is simpler, cheaper, and more aligned with the agent network model

**MVP (P0 only):** 12 days  
**Beta (P0 + P1):** 17 days  
**Production Ready:** 27 days
